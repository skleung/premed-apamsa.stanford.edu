This website is for the Pre-med APAMSA Organization at Stanford University.
Marks my first attempts at using LESS (the CSS extention) and more stuff with jQuery.

Goals include:
	A scrollbar that automatically docks when you scroll down past the home page.
	A cool looking logo to use for future branding...
